#=============RULER=====================================================|
desc="Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes 
data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.
It is designed to be a reliable 'back-end' tool that can be used 
directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same 
time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, 
since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and 
has several interesting built-in capabilities.
Although the project development is marked as beta, GNU Netcat is 
already enough stable for everyday use.
Goals of this project are full compatibility with the original nc 1.10 
that is widely used, and portability."
