    "desc": "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a method to validate the \nauthenticity of an otherwise unknown entity across untrusted networks. \nPKI works by establishing a chain of trust, rather than trusting each \nindividual host or entity explicitly. In order for a certificate \npresented by a remote entity to be trusted, that certificate must \npresent a complete chain of certificates that can be validated using \nthe root certificate of a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted \nby the local machine."
