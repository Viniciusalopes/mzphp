    "desc": "i3status is a small program for generating a status bar for i3bar,\ndzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient\nby issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants\nto update such a status line every second. This ensures that even under\nhigh load, your status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit\nof energy by not hogging your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding\namount of shell commands would."
