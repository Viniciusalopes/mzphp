    "desc": "Libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library originally \nbased on code from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic \nbuilding blocks: symmetric cipher algorithms (AES, Arcfour, Blowfish, \nCamellia, CAST5, ChaCha20 DES, GOST28147, Salsa20, SEED, Serpent, \nTwofish) and modes (ECB,CFB,CBC,OFB,CTR,CCM,GCM,OCB,POLY1305,AESWRAP),\nhash algorithms (MD2, MD4, MD5, GOST R 34.11, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, \nSHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, \nSHA3-512, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256, TIGER-192, Whirlpool), MACs (HMAC for \nall hash algorithms, CMAC for all cipher algorithms, GMAC-AES, \nGMAC-CAMELLIA, GMAC-TWOFISH, GMAC-SERPENT, GMAC-SEED, Poly1305, \nPoly1305-AES, Poly1305-CAMELLIA, Poly1305-TWOFISH, Poly1305-SERPENT, \nPoly1305-SEED), public key algorithms (RSA, Elgamal, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, \nECDH), large integer functions, random numbers and a lot of supporting\nfunctions.\n\nLibgcrypt works on most POSIX systems and many pre-POSIX systems. \nIt can also be built using a cross-compiler system for \nMicrosoft Windows."
