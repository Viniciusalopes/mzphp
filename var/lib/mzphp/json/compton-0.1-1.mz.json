    "desc": "I was frustrated by the low amount of standalone lightweight\ncompositors. Compton was forked from Dana Jansens fork of xcompmgr\nand refactored. I fixed whatever bug I found, and added features I\nwanted. Things seem stable, but dont quote me on it. I will most\nlikely be actively working on this until I get the features I want.\nThis is also a learning experience for me. That is, Im partially\ndoing this out of a desire to learn Xlib."
