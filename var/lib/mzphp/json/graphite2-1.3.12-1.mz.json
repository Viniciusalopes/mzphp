    "desc": "Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are\nTrueType fonts with additional tables containing smart rendering\ninformation and were originally developed to support complex non-Roman\nwriting systems.\n\nThey may contain rules for e.g. ligatures, glyph substitution, kerning,\njustification - this can make them useful even on text written in Roman\nwriting systems such as English. Note that firefox by default provides\nan internal copy of the graphite engine and cannot use a system version\n(although it can now be patched to use it), but it too should benefit\nfrom the availability of graphite fonts."
