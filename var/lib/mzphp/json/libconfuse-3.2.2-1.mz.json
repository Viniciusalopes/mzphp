It supports sections\nand (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other\nsections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted\nstrings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include\nstatements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability\nto a program using a simple API."
