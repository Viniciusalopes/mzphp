    "desc": "D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications \nto talk to one another. D-Bus supplies both a system daemon \n(for events such as \u201cnew hardware device added\u201d \nor \u201cprinter queue changed\u201d) and a per-user-login-session daemon \n(for general IPC needs among user applications). \nAlso, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one \nmessage passing framework, which can be used by any two applications \nto communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon)."
