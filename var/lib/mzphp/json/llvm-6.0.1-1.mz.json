    "desc": "The LLVM package contains a collection of modular and reusable \ncompiler and toolchain technologies. The Low Level Virtual Machine \n(LLVM) Core libraries provide a modern source and target-independent \noptimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs \n(as well as some less common ones!). These libraries are built around \na well specified code representation known as the LLVM \nintermediate representation (LLVM IR)."
